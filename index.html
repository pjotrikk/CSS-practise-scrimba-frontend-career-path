          <h2>Finding simplicity in life</h2>

          <p class="basic--text">
            <span class="bold">Life can get complicated really quickly</span>,
            but it doesn't have to be! There are many ways to simplify your
            life, <a href="#"> a few of which we've explored in the past</a>.
            This week we're taking a bit of a approach though, in how you can
            find simplicity in the life you already living.

            <h2>Keeping cooking simple</h2>
            <p>
              Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to
              be healthy, you have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do
              that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.

            <h2>Simplicity and work</h2>
            <p>
              Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it
              ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By
              keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance
              everything out.

            <h2>Simple decorations</h2>
            <p>
              A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either
              don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the
              impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye
              where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
